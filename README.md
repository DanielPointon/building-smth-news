## Aligning incentives

News should be:
* Accurate
* Unbiased, or with bias that does not impact the key information

How do we align incentive (profit) with these goals?

Current incentives:
* Clicks
* Subscriptions

These encourage clickbait etc

Short sellers exist, similar business model
* Expose fraud/bad practices, and the accuracy of their reporting correlates with their profit
