## Aligning incentives

News should be:
* Accurate
* Unbiased, or with bias that does not impact the key information

How do we align incentive (profit) with these goals?

Current incentives:
* Clicks
* Subscriptions

These encourage clickbait etc

Short sellers exist, similar business model
* Expose fraud/bad practices, and the accuracy of their reporting correlates with their profit

Can link market to other providers (Manifold, Polymarket, Kalshi):
* Initial odds
* Comparison

Why would users not just bet on other sites?
* Downside/loss
* No downside betting on our site, but potential upside
