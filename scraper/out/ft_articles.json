Airlines, telecoms companies and gyms have been getting in on the act.

And smoothing out the Black Friday peak over several weeks or a month eases pressure on supply chain logistics, as well as the growing headache of processing online returns."}, {"type": "text", "content": "Nevertheless, I was surprised that men are predicted to be bigger Black Friday spenders than women this year. Tan says this is because men target high-value tech purchases for themselves, noting how releases of new gadgets, games and software tend to happen during the autumn (VR headsets are particularly sought-after this year). Women, meanwhile, are more inclined to start their Christmas shopping early, and spend money buying discounted gifts for others."}, {"type": "text", "content": "Black Friday refuseniks may well question whether some of these discounts are illusory. A study by consumer group Which? has found that nine out of 10 Black Friday deals offered by major retail groups in 2023 were available to buy at the same price or lower at other points in the year."}, {"type": "text", "content": "However, next year will be the real test for consumers and retailers alike. As the largest private sector employer in the UK, the retail industry has been howling about National Insurance increases in the Budget, which stand to wipe billions off the bottom line. Bosses warn they will have to pass on price rises to shoppers as well as cut jobs. If inflation and unemployment statistics start heading upwards, consumers are likely to pull their horns in further.
