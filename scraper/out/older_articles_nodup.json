That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that the increase in defence spending and replacement of arms sent to Ukraine do not simply reload US stockpiles but retools them and the defence industry that supplies them. While the margins on expensive \u201cexquisite\u201d systems and maintenance will enable prime defence contractors to buy back stock, more money should go into research and development. This could enable us to one day supplement, if not replace, F-35 fighters and the apparatus around them \u2014 including mid-air refuelling aircraft and ground staff \u2014 with long-range autonomous drone units. At a minimum, the profits could go to acquire new companies, bolstering the incentive structure for defence start-ups building a different future of American weaponry."}, {"type": "text", "content": "A second lesson is that we need systems that can communicate effectively even in challenging environments, particularly those saturated with electronic warfare. A clear lesson from the Ukrainian front has been the challenge of operating amid GPS denial and spoofing, while targeting enemy forces 100km or more away. In such scenarios, traditional electronic navigation systems can become compromised, leaving missions incomplete and forces vulnerable. We need weapons and systems that can function reliably even when conventional methods fail, including GPS alternatives like quantum navigation and visual odometry. These technologies are not just about surviving in a contested environment but ensuring we have an information advantage over our adversaries in the most critical moments. We need to ready ourselves to procure what we need to fight whenever and wherever, which in this new age will most likely be overseas in places filled with electronic warfare."}, {"type": "text", "content": "The final lesson is the impact of asymmetric warfare in creating disparities in the cost-capability ratio, which is only accentuated the longer a conflict persists. As we\u2019ve seen in Ukraine, it is unsustainable to fire a $4mn patriot missile to intercept a $50,000 Shahed drone. The canonical example in the US is the fear that a few $10mn-$20mn Chinese DF-21 or DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles could destroy a US aircraft carrier, its equipment and its 6,000 member crew \u2014 all for less than 1 per cent of the carrier\u2019s $13bn price tag. To combat these fears, we need cheaper, more numerous alternatives that take advantage of interconnected and nimble software. But this will require procurement reform that moves beyond best price contracts and path dependency. Rather, we need more sophisticated purchasing approaches that weigh total cost and supply chain resilience with other factors like performance and adaptability."}, {"type": "text", "content": "There are certain headwinds that could keep defence budgets from rising indefinitely.

That would hasten the arrival of the first-ever trillion-dollar US defence budget."}, {"type": "text", "content": "While the majority of this money would likely focus on programmes of record and sustaining the rising cost of healthcare and pension costs for our soldiers, sailors, air force and guardians, there are some glimmers that the US is taking innovation seriously. The country\u2019s National Defense Authorization Act, which authorises funding levels for the US military, envisioned a fivefold increase in the budget for the Defense Innovation Unit in the last year to almost $1bn.
