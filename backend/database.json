Raw depicts female figures in intimate scenes, relaxing or passionately embracing against idyllic backdrops. Richly rendered animals, flora and fauna heighten the ethereal qualities of these images, which seem to envelop her subjects in dreamlike worlds. The new works she has created over the month-and-half-long residency will be on show for a year."

Alongside, Vicious Circles marks the first US survey of the late artist Jacqueline de Jong, a key figure in postwar European avant-garde. Known for merging art with politics, De Jong\u2019s expressive, humour-filled paintings address themes of war, power and protest. The exhibition explores her radical legacy as an artist, editor and publisher."

This resulted from the incorporation of China and other developing countries into the world economy. There followed a profound shift in the balance of power between labour and capital and a tilt in the distributional struggle between debtors and creditors in favour of the latter.

Trump has pledged to pursue a plethora of inflationary macroeconomic and trade policies, such as expansive tax cuts, heavy import tariffs and mass deportations of immigrants which will impose serious tightening in labour markets. In effect the US economy will confront big supply shocks coinciding with expansionary fiscal policy. This points inexorably to higher and more volatile inflation, all against the background of public debt surging past 100 per cent of GDP and expectations of a more deregulatory environment in banking that will encourage a return to excessive risk taking."

He has introduced legislation to prohibit the Fed from launching its own digital currency. If enacted, says Obstfeld, the prohibition would leave more room for unregulated cryptocurrencies, potentially facilitating illicit activities.

These days (mostly through the FT) I get job protection, a generous chunk of maternity leave at full pay and even a coach to ease my return to work. In general I am in favour of policies to support those of us who nobly breed future taxpayers. But is it possible to go too far?"

Childbirth warrants some recovery time, and though communication isn\u2019t my toddler\u2019s strong suit, I think he appreciated the home rest too. More recently, expanded benefits for parents have been seen as a way to promote gender equality or even boost the birth rate. By pulling men on to more nappy duty, paternity leave could even out the load of childrearing."

One review found that although leave of up to around six months improves mothers\u2019 chances of returning to paid work, more than about a year has the opposite effect. When in the 1980s and 1990s the French and German governments expanded it beyond that point, paid employment and wages for mothers suffered."

Another found that in Germany more generous maternity benefits meant small companies hired fewer women of childbearing age into roles that were tricky to cover."

A new working paper finds, for example, that men taking long stints are penalised when applying for jobs in male-dominated sectors. Another study found that in Norway, making paternity leave more generous lowered men\u2019s earnings by 1-3 per cent. They argued that this was because of a \u201crat race\u201d, whereby one father taking time out opened up space for colleagues to get ahead. (The authors\u2019 fix is for all fathers to use their allotted leave.)"

The authors of the Spanish study reckon there are two mechanisms at play: men waking up to the realities of caring for a newborn full-time; and women enjoying improved career prospects, pushing back further procreation."

My memories of the period after my son was born are hazy, but I think I spent about that much on nappies and wipes alone. As this is my final column before going on maternity leave for a second time, I am looking forward to the opportunity for a refresher \u2014 and grateful that the FT\u2019s policy is more generous."

We discussed the serious concerns I and many others have about the legislation \u2014 she told me repeatedly that I would be reassured by the tight language in the bill.

This is a huge oversight. As I told Leadbeater, sick and disabled people are one of the most at-risk groups for coercion and abuse, whether in relationships in a romantic or familial setting or in institutional care. Many are already made to feel like burdens, or have essential support withheld as a means of control. It is astonishingly naive to argue that doctors and judges could spot this type of coercion, especially when it is not explicitly described in the bill."

What about if it is based on your feelings of guilt that your children have been left to care for you, with the wait for social care longer than your life expectancy?

The bill assumes that in these positions of power an individual would only act as a check or safeguard. But disability activists like me know all too well that they could potentially be the biggest risk of all. Medical ableism is a well-documented phenomenon, with disabled people routinely ignored and patronised, treated as drains on limited resources or simply assumed to have poor quality of life. We saw the deadly consequences of these attitudes during Covid, when thousands of disabled people had \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d orders placed on their files without their consent."

But as relations between China and Taiwan worsen, some countries are taking steps to become less reliant on Taiwanese chips. Already, the US, Germany and Japan have lured Taiwanese semiconductor makers to their own shores. Could that make Taiwan a more vulnerable target for attack?"

Many of the creatures (both real and fantastical) are inspired by Cornish wildlife, and as Zee occasionally pauses on his quest to draw them in his own notebook, the actual draft sketches of those animals (by artist Uriel Cordas) are revealed on screen.Pinto aimed to recreate \u201cthe illusion of\u00a0a watercolour animated movie within a\u00a0game engine\u201d, which he has certainly achieved.

(Recognising this, developers rotate gameplay in 30-degree increments if you\u2019re sitting\u00a0still \u2013 far from ideal.) Roto VR, working together with Meta, has ingeniously addressed this with a chair that physically rotates you as\u00a0the game requires, effectively eliminating motion sickness.

This was when he began building AARON, a rudimentary AI that could draw semi-autonomously. Unlike today\u2019s AI image generators, which make pictures based on analysing real images, AARON\u2019s drawings were based purely on the mathematical rules Cohen programmed. Over the years, he continued to improve AARON, teaching it to draw with imprecise strokes to mimic a human hand, to detect shapes and shade them in, even to physically draw with the help of a device called a \u201cturtle\u201d that would scurry across the canvas making marks. One 1979 artwork is a playful piece of abstraction, reminiscent of a child\u2019s drawing of a fantastical map. It is pretty, and looks at home on a gallery wall. Cohen would continue to tinker and collaborate with AARON for the rest of his life."

This spans a period of immense technological development during which, as curator Val Ravaglia points out, the computer evolved from being the size of an entire room to a discreet box that could fit on or under a desk. The artists who harnessed and responded to this rapid social change provide an intriguing precedent for many of the conversations playing out in the art world today."

While movements such as Pop art and Minimalism gained traction in the mainstream, an international group of like-minded artists gathered around the hub of Zagreb in present-day Croatia, to share work inspired by scientific and mathematical ideas. They became known by the name of their exhibition series, New Tendencies, presenting art that might today be classified as kinetic or optical art; works that either literally move or give the illusion of movement."

The Tate exhibition also shines a spotlight on the influential 1968 exhibition Cybernetic Serendipity at London\u2019s ICA, the first large-scale exhibition dedicated to the computer as both medium and inspiration.

This shift gives local governments some badly needed breathing room after being told to eliminate implicit debt. Additionally, I estimate the debt restructuring could save Rmb600bn in interest costs over the same period. For years local governments had to squeeze their budgets, generating fiscal surpluses just to keep implicit debts at bay.

But by converting implicit debt into explicit, interest-bearing bonds, the government is doing more than bookkeeping. This shift gives local governments some badly needed breathing room after being told to eliminate implicit debt. Additionally, I estimate the debt restructuring could save Rmb600bn in interest costs over the same period. For years local governments had to squeeze their budgets, generating fiscal surpluses just to keep implicit debts at bay. Now they can allocate more resources towards development and essential services."

This shift gives local governments some badly needed breathing room after being told to eliminate implicit debt. Additionally, I estimate the debt restructuring could save Rmb600bn in interest costs over the same period. For years local governments had to squeeze their budgets, generating fiscal surpluses just to keep implicit debts at bay.

Just as they had no plan for the economy once we\u2019d left the EU, they had no idea what to do once they\u2019d cut their hated Common Agricultural Policy subsidies. The Johnson government dithered and blathered, offering small, fiddly grants. It extolled British animal welfare and food quality, but waved in imports full of chemicals and signed a trade deal with Australia which was a triumph of doublespeak. It eventually settled on paying farmers to improve soil and biodiversity. Now, the new government has frozen those grants, throwing the sector into yet more turmoil."

But it requires a pragmatic focus on what\u2019s possible and a sharp eye on geography. Sam Alvis, director of energy at UK policy research agency Public First, told me the Labour government\u2019s decision to get Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage technology off the ground was a good example. CCUS, which captures and stores the carbon otherwise emitted from sites like power stations or cement factories, will create clusters of jobs in communities still dominated by industry such as Teesside, and it will also allow more industrial jobs to continue to exist."
