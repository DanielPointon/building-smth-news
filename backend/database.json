Some died, others figured out ways to use without overdosing, so the remaining fentanyl-naive drug-using population has shrunk.

Raw depicts female figures in intimate scenes, relaxing or passionately embracing against idyllic backdrops. Richly rendered animals, flora and fauna heighten the ethereal qualities of these images, which seem to envelop her subjects in dreamlike worlds. The new works she has created over the month-and-half-long residency will be on show for a year."

Etched with messages from enslaved women to their children, these vessels strike a haunting note that reverberates throughout the show.

Alongside, Vicious Circles marks the first US survey of the late artist Jacqueline de Jong, a key figure in postwar European avant-garde. Known for merging art with politics, De Jong\u2019s expressive, humour-filled paintings address themes of war, power and protest.

This resulted from the incorporation of China and other developing countries into the world economy.

In effect the US economy will confront big supply shocks coinciding with expansionary fiscal policy. This points inexorably to higher and more volatile inflation, all against the background of public debt surging past 100 per cent of GDP and expectations of a more deregulatory environment in banking that will encourage a return to excessive risk taking."

Just as they had no plan for the economy once we\u2019d left the EU, they had no idea what to do once they\u2019d cut their hated Common Agricultural Policy subsidies. The Johnson government dithered and blathered, offering small, fiddly grants. It extolled British animal welfare and food quality, but waved in imports full of chemicals and signed a trade deal with Australia which was a triumph of doublespeak. It eventually settled on paying farmers to improve soil and biodiversity. Now, the new government has frozen those grants, throwing the sector into yet more turmoil."
